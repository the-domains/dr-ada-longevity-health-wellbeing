Stress is almost inherent for our generation. It is conducted from the mother to a fetus. Only a healthy lifestyle and diet can help in countering even a serious lifestyle hazard like stress. Excessive stress affects our organs and weakens them. It also affects the brain and makes one feel depressed. Eat natural foods that contain Omega 3 fatty acids, Vitamin C and magnesium as they can help you cope with stress. Fish, dairy products and nuts are rich sources of these nutrients.
